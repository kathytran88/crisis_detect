                <h3>The correlation between mortgage delinquencies and housing prices in the 2000s</h3>
                <p>The plot shows data from 2002 to 2008. When delinquency rate was low at around 1% to 1.5%, house prices did not differ much from each other. But as delinquency rates increased over time, a clear pattern appeared which indicated that as more people delayed paying their mortgages, the lower the house prices became.</p>
